### Interesting Article on Software Development
I found an interesting article about Agile Development:  
[Agile Software Development - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

### Why I Found This Interesting
I find Agile fascinating because it emphasizes **adaptability** and **continuous improvement** in software projects.  
Instead of locking teams into a rigid plan, Agile allows developers to adjust quickly to changing requirements and real-world user feedback.

Compared to the traditional **Waterfall** model, Agile:
- Encourages **flexibility** and **collaboration**.
- Delivers value in **small, iterative steps** rather than all at once.
- Makes it easier to **spot problems early** and adapt solutions before they become expensive.
